# E-Crypto

A simple online Decrypto-like game. Available in English and Polish. Uses a custom word set and allows re-rolling a few words at the start of the game, but otherwise plays the same as the boardgame. An extrenal voice chat program is required to play (though being in the same room works too). 

The game is mostly optimised for desktops/laptops. While playable on a phone (horizontal mode is recommended), the pc version will offer the best experience.
